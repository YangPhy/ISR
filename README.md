# ISR

This is the initial state radiation (ISR) at a possible lepton collider (either an electron-positron collider or a muon collider). The structure function includes all orders of soft and soft-collinear photons and the hard-collinear photons up to the third order. Several Standard Model (SM) processes are implemented in Mathematica as examples: (ll > tt, ll > ww, ll > zz, and ll > zh)
